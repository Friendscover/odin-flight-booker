# odin-flight-booker

This is one of [TheOdinProjects](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-advanced-forms) project about advanced forms. This project should make me familiar with advanced forms e.g. nested_forms and the select_tag/options_for_select helper methods. 

After finishing this exercise you should be able to book flights, enter payment information and add new passengers to the available flights.
